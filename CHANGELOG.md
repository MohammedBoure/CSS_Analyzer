## Initial Commit - CSS Duplicate Rules Analyzer

### Added
- `main.py`: Python script to recursively scan directories for CSS files, identify duplicate CSS rules across multiple files, and generate a consolidated `shared_rules.css` file in directories containing duplicates.
- Support for modern CSS properties (e.g., flexbox, grid, rem units, CSS variables `var()`) by disabling strict validation in `cssutils`.
- Detailed `README.md` file containing:
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage guidelines
  - Example output
  - Troubleshooting tips
  - Arabic summary section for better accessibility and localization
- Debug output showing:
  - Number of parsed CSS files
  - Rule counts per file
  - Detected duplicate CSS rules across files

### Changed
- Configured `cssutils` to suppress warnings and errors for a cleaner output.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- **Attribution in Output Files**: Added a header comment to `shared_rules.css` files, noting they were generated by the CSS Analyzer Python tool, including the toolâ€™s file path and timestamp.
- **Completion Status in Report**: Added a note in `css_analysis_report.md` specifying the tool used and its path, plus a `Processing Status` section confirming successful analysis completion with a timestamp.
- **Duplicate Properties Removal**: The tool now identifies and removes duplicate properties within CSS rules in individual files, reducing file size and improving maintainability.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Added tracking of duplicate properties removed per file and directory in the `css_analysis_report.md`.

### Fixed
- Resolved an error where `'CSSStyleSheet' object has no attribute 'removeRule'` prevented the removal of duplicate rules across files, using the updated `cssutils` API.

### Improved
- Improved the accuracy of the report to include precise counts of duplicate properties removed.
- Maintained consistent debugging output for parsed files, rules, and duplicates.
- Optimized `parse_css_files` to return both the rules dictionary and the count of duplicate properties removed for better report accuracy.

### Notes
- Tested on the `EduConnect-FrontEnd` project, successfully processing 10 CSS files in `admin/css` (591 rules, 91 duplicates) and 11 files in `css` (342 rules, 37 duplicates), with no errors.
- Users can exclude irrelevant directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`) and specific CSS files using `--exclude-dirs` and `--exclude-files`.
- The tool is part of the `CSS_Analyzer` repository (https://github.com/MohammedBoure/CSS_Analyzer).
